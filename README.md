# Respacer

Apply indentation to a solution, a project, a folder, or a file. 
This is a great way to normalize the use of tabs or spaces without affecting other formatting. 

Tabify and Untabify commands are provided on the right click menus in the Solution Explorer or 
in the code editor. Indent size (the amount of space at the beginning of indented lines) and 
tab size (the amount of spacing after non-whitespace) are applied according to the Visual 
Studio editor options for the given file.
